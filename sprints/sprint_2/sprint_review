Sprint 2 Review:

Describe what you completed this sprint.

How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? 
Describe in terms of high level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.

  We have planned out the structure and design of our program so that we can approach the coding of the project with a well thought out blueprint to implement.
  Research on NLP libraries has progressed well; we have settled on a promising legally-trained library that we have had success with in initial testiing.

What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

  Planning-wise, we have assigned team roles and created a system and schedule for approaching each sprint going forward that helps each team member understand
  what is their responsibility to do by the end of the sprint. We have created a living document to help us track all of the plans and materials relevant to
  our project.
