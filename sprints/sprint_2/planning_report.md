Sprint 2 Planning Report

Capacity: How much work can your team do this sprint? (More, less, or the same as last sprint.) Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.

We expect to be able to do more than the last sprint since we had relatively little to do last sprint and people are busy but not unable to do any work busy.

Goals: Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.

On the management end we are assigning initial team roles and responsibilities to each team member, finishing connecting everyone's individual computers to the GitHub repository, establishing a weekly schedule for handling sprints, and establishing our organizational system on our Trello board. For development we are completing the research for our potential use of NLP libraries. Finally, for planning we are creating the first draft of our product's structure and design, the languages we will use, and the organizational structure for our development process.
