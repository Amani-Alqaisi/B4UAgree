# Sprint 6 Planning Report

## Capacity:
Our team's capacity for this sprint is expected to be relatively the same as the previous sprint with general expectation of each team contributing about 5-10 hours of work, probably on the higher end of that estimate. Each team member will dedicate the time they have available based on their commitments and responsibilities. The accuracy of time estimates has been considered in task planning, and we allocate time for development ramp-up. 

## Goals:
Our main goal is to get the code polished to the point of our MVP.

1. **Development:**
   - Implement ratings of the privacy policy
   - Parsing HTML Content
   - Factor in HTML headings into review
   - Critical Information in Summarizer

2. **Testing**
   - Front-End Testing: Verifying the summary output excludes unnecessary information
   - Back-End Testing: Creating a test suite for flask_controller's app.py

3. **Milestone**
   - Code Review (Groups: Joe, Amani, and Liam -- Mai and Mia) 
   - Revise Demo Presentation
   - Write-Up
