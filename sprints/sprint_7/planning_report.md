# Sprint 7 Planning Report

## Capacity:
Our team's capacity for this sprint is expected to be relatively the same as the previous sprint with a general expectation of each team contributing about 5-10 hours of work, probably on the higher end of that estimate. Each team member will dedicate their available time based on their commitments and responsibilities. The accuracy of time estimates has been considered in task planning, and we allocate time for development ramp-up. 

## Goals:
Our main goal is to fix bugs from the Demo into the MVP and incorporate the updated summary and privacy policy rating.

1. **Development:**
   - Fixing front-end bugs
   - Incorporate a Rating System for Privacy Policy Safety in main branch
   - Linking the scoring with the Front end
   - Automate the deployment process
   - Update Summarizer

2. **Testing**
   - Front-End Testing: "Learn more" button & Privacy Policy Rating
   - Back-End Testing: Creating a test suite for flask_controller's hello.py

3. **Milestone**
