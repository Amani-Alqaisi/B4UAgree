# Capacity
Our group is ramping up well for setup. We’re dividing research and project management tasks amongst members depending on their schedules and preferences. We estimate that the same amount of time from last week’s assignment can be maintained into next week. 

# Goals
For Milestone: Analyze peer reviews. The ones you wrote and the ones written about your project. 
For Milestone: Project Setup. Create GitHub Repo, Create Issues, Resources 
Group Prep: Research & Investigate NLP Algorithms we can use for B4UAgree

# Task breakdown
- Review Peer Review Proposals 
- Project Setup:
- GitHub repository creation and initial setup
- Setup Trello for issue tracking 
- Decide Roles 
- Create a consistent schedule for need out-of-lab meetings
- Algorithm Integration Kickoff:
-- Research and initiate integration steps: Find NLP algorithms, Limitations, and Ideas
-- Group meeting and presentation 
-- Decide tasks and goals for experimentation of NLP algorithms

# Issue Tracker
Our instructor can monitor our first sprint's progress on our Trello Board, observing the status of tasks and any updates provided by team members. The Trello Board serves as a central hub for tracking our initial steps in setting up the project and laying the groundwork for subsequent sprints.
