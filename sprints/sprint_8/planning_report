# Sprint 7 Planning Report

## Capacity:
Our team's capacity for this sprint is expected to be relatively the same as the previous sprint with a general expectation of each team contributing about 5-10 hours of work, probably on the higher end of that estimate. Each team member will dedicate their available time based on their commitments and responsibilities. The accuracy of time estimates has been considered in task planning, and we allocate time for development ramp-up. 

## Goals:
Our main goal is to clean up, smooth out and otherwise finalize our project.

2. **Testing**
