# Sprint 3 Planning Report

## Capacity:
Our team's capacity for this sprint is expected to be relatively the same as the previous sprint. Each team member will dedicate the time they have available based on their commitments and responsibilities. The accuracy of time estimates for last week's tasks will be considered in task planning.

## Goals:
1. **NLP Algorithm Integration:**
   - Continue the integration of the BERT Extractive Summarizer for privacy policy analysis.
   - Address issues identified during the initial testing phase.

2. **Scraping and Data Collection:**
   - Implement scraping functionality to gather privacy policies from various sources.
   - Investigate and address challenges encountered during the initial scraping process.

3. **Back-End Development:**
   - Develop the back-end features for information transfer between the front-end and NLP algorithm.
   - Explore different models for summarizing and evaluating their effectiveness.

4. **Front-End Setup:**
   - Initiate the creation of the Chrome extension's front-end interface.
   - Define the connection layer requirements for data transfer between front-end and back-end.

## Issue Tracker:
Our instructor can view the results of our sprint planning using our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/yHP9CPjB/b4uagree). Each sprint planning report generates Trello cards corresponding to specific tasks assigned to team members. The progress of each sprint can be tracked through the Trello board associated with the project.
