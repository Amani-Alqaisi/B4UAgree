## Building and Testing Instructions:
Instructions for building and testing the system:

### Building the System:
1. Download or pull the code from the designated repository.
2. Install required libraries/programs:
   - Python: Download and install Python.
   - Install Python libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install -U sentence-transformers
     pip install Flask
     pip install flask_cors
     pip install bs4
     pip install bert-extractive-summarizer
     ```
   - If encountering permissions errors, add "--user" to the end of the pip install command.
3. Run the Flask controller by executing flask_controller.py in your preferred code editor or terminal. Ensure that the Flask server is running on your computer.

### Testing the System:
1. Navigate to a website with a cookie notification (e.g., Barnes and Noble).
2. Click on the B4UAgree extension.
3. Note: The extension may not work on every site due to difficulties in finding a privacy policy.

### Running the System:
Instructions for running the system:

#### Adding Chrome Extension:
1. Open the Chrome Browser.
2. Navigate to the puzzle piece icon in the upper right-hand corner and click.
3. Click "Manage Extensions" in the drop-down options.
4. Toggle "Developer Mode" to the right (should become blue).
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder downloaded from the GitHub repository on your computer.
6. If encountering configuration errors, remove the "_pycache_" folder from the extension folder and repeat the steps.
7. If errors persist, adjust the localhost address in content.js to reflect your PC's IP address.

#### Using Chrome Extension:
1. Navigate to a webpage, preferably with a cookie policy.
2. Click the puzzle piece in the right-hand corner.
3. Select B4UAgree from the drop-down menu.

## Issue Tracking:
We use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/yHP9CPjB/ATTI94bb9185c9e2341b7aa2fe8585214bb5811623F3/b4uagree) for issue tracking. Each sprint planning report creates a set of Trello cards that map to specific tasks assigned to team members. We prioritize transparency and collaboration by encouraging the community to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements through our Trello board.

## Navigating Sprints:
- Sprint planning and review reports are found in the [/sprints](./sprints) directory.
- Each sprint corresponds to a milestone, and tasks for the sprint are created as cards on our Trello board.
- The progress of each sprint can be tracked through the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/yHP9CPjB/ATTI94bb9185c9e2341b7aa2fe8585214bb5811623F3/b4uagree) associated with the project.
