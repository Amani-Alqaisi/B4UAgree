# B4UAgree - Empowering Your Online Privacy!

## Project Overview:
B4UAgree is a browser extension plug-in designed to enhance user awareness and understanding of privacy policies encountered during online browsing. Our goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about their online privacy by providing real-time analysis and summaries of privacy policies.

## Repository Layout:
- Currently: ReadMe file. A major directory called sprints contains weekly sub-directories consisting of planning reports and other relevant documents to the sprint. 
- Expected and Future Files: An HTML file, index.html, for the Chrome Browser extension. A JavaScript (Node.JS) file, main.js, to form the connection between our interface and the NLP algorithm. A Python or Java file to analyze the privacy policy and return comprehensive summaries. 

## Issue Tracking:
We use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/yHP9CPjB/ATTI94bb9185c9e2341b7aa2fe8585214bb5811623F3/b4uagree) for issue tracking. Each sprint planning report creates a set of Trello cards that map to specific tasks assigned to team members. We prioritize transparency and collaboration by encouraging the community to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements through our Trello board.

## Sprint Planning:
- Sprint planning reports are found in the [Sprints directory](./sprints) directory.
- Each sprint corresponds to a milestone, and tasks for the sprint are created as cards on our Trello board.
- The progress of each sprint can be tracked through the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/yHP9CPjB/ATTI94bb9185c9e2341b7aa2fe8585214bb5811623F3/b4uagree) associated with the project.
